    "This defines the approximate posterior distribution, which takes as input an observation and outputs a set of parameters for specifying the conditional distribution of the latent representation. In this example, we simply model the distribution as a diagonal Gaussian, and the network outputs the mean and log-variance parameters of a factorized Gaussian. We output log-variance instead of the variance directly for numerical stability.\n",

However, this sampling operation creates a bottleneck because backpropagation cannot flow through a random node.\n",
